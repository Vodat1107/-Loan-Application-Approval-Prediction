# Loan Application Approval Prediction

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a loan application will be accepted or rejected based on the provided customer details.

## Dataset Details

- **Dataset URL**: [Loan Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishek14398/loan-dataset/data)
- **Description**: This dataset contains customer information used for loan approval decisions. The key attributes include:
  - **Income**
  - **Credit History**
  - **Employment Type**
  - **Loan Amount**
  - **Other financial and demographic attributes**

## Requirements

### 1. Data Understanding and Cleaning
- **Exploration**: Begin by exploring the dataset to identify any missing values, inconsistencies, or outliers in the data.
- **Cleaning**: Handle missing values using imputation techniques. Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features to prepare the data for machine learning models.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Correlations**: Visualize correlations between features and the loan acceptance/rejection decision.
- **Class Distribution**: Analyze the distribution of accepted vs. rejected loans.
- **Feature Analysis**: Identify and analyze the most important features affecting loan approval decisions. Present any insights that might inform the model-building strategy.

### 3. Model Development
- **Classification Models**: Train and compare at least three classification models such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees / Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, or CatBoost)
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- **Feature Selection**: Select the most relevant features for improving model efficiency.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using key classification metrics such as:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision & Recall
  - F1 Score
  - AUC-ROC Curve
  - Compare model performance and select the best-performing one.

### 4. Explainability
- **Model Interpretation**: Use techniques such as SHAP values or feature importance to explain the model's predictions.
- **Key Features**: Identify the most important metrics influencing loan approval and explain their relevance to the model.

### 5. Deployment Simulation 
- **Run the deployment script** to use the app and get a loan approval prediction.
